Modify the Polymarket Dashboard to use real trading data from the autonomous trader instead of mock data.

CURRENT SETUP:
- Dashboard is at: /Users/aniketsindhu/.openclaw/workspace/polymarket-dashboard
- Trading data is at: /Users/aniketsindhu/.openclaw/workspace/polymarket-agents-official/data/autonomous_trader_state.json
- Dashboard currently uses mock data in lib/data.ts

CHANGES NEEDED:

1. Update lib/data.ts to read from the real trading data file:
   - Read from: ../polymarket-agents-official/data/autonomous_trader_state.json
   - Parse the JSON structure: { positions: [], closed_positions: [], realized_pnl: number, cycle_count: number }
   - Map the data to the TradingData interface
   - Add live price fetching for open positions (fetch current prices from Polymarket API)
   - Calculate current P&L for each open position

2. Update lib/types.ts if needed to match the actual data structure

3. Create a simple API route (app/api/data/route.ts) that serves the trading data:
   - Read the JSON file
   - Fetch live prices for open positions
   - Return combined data
   - This will be called by the dashboard components

4. Update the dashboard components to fetch from the API:
   - Modify fetchTradingData() to call /api/data
   - Keep the same component structure, just change data source
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

5. Handle errors gracefully:
   - If file doesn't exist, return empty data
   - If API fails, show loading state
   - Add error boundaries

The dashboard should now show:
- Real open positions from the trader
- Real closed trades with actual P&L
- Live calculated P&L based on current market prices
- Real-time updates every 30 seconds
