Setup real-time database for Polymarket Dashboard using Upstash Redis:

1. Create Upstash Redis instance at https://console.upstash.com
2. Get the Redis URL and token
3. Install ioredis in both projects
4. Update autonomous_trader.py to write to Redis every cycle
5. Update dashboard API route to read from Redis
6. Add environment variables for Redis connection

Changes needed:
- Install: npm install ioredis
- Update lib/data.ts to fetch from Redis API
- Create lib/redis.ts for Redis client
- Update app/api/data/route.ts to use Redis
- Add REDIS_URL to environment variables

The data should be stored as JSON in Redis key "trading:state" and updated every 3 minutes by the trader.

Generate all necessary code changes.
